# spring-esdata-loader-demo submodule

**Spring Boot** based demo application, to show how to use the library to test your own projects, using either **JUnit4** or new **JUnit Jupiter**.

This project uses awesome [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) library to setup a Dockerized Elasticseach server during the tests.

So to run the tests locally, you must have **Docker** installed.
