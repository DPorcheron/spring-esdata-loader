# spring-esdata-loader-demo

**Spring Boot** based demo application, to show how to use this testing library, using either **JUnit 4** or new **JUnit Jupiter** platform.

This project uses testing library [Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) to setup a dockerized Elasticseach server during the tests.

So to run the tests locally, you must have **Docker** installed.
